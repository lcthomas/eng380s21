# Final Project -- 25%
* **Due during finals week**
    * **You will bring a copy of your final project abstract to class on Monday, April 26**
     * **You will turn in your final project abstract as part of response paper 5, due Wednesday, April 28**
* **2000-2500 words (~7-8 pages double-spaced)**
* **MLA/Chicago style**
* **Turn in via the “Final Project” portal on Blackboard Assignments page.**

Your final project will be a revision and extension of paper 2. You will add another text to your argument: either Claudia Rankine's *Citizen*, which we will read during the second-to-last week of class, OR a text you bring in yourself from outside the class. I will update this assignment page as we near the end of the semester, and we will talk more about this assignment in class.
