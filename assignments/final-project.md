# Final Project -- 30%
* **Due Monday, May 10**
    * **We will hold an in-class workshop devoted to the final project on Monday, April 26**
    * **If you decide to change your topic/argument/text from paper 2, you must email me with a 1-2 paragraph description of your new argument by Friday, April 30**
* **2000-2500 words (~7-8 pages double-spaced)**
* **MLA/Chicago style**
* **Turn in via the “Final Project” portal on Blackboard Assignments page.**

Your final project will be a revision and extension of paper 2. You will add another text to your argument: either Claudia Rankine's *Citizen*, which we will read during the second-to-last week of class, OR a text you bring in yourself from outside the class. We will hold an in-class workshop on Monday, April 26 devoted to developing your ideas for revision and extension of paper 2.

You may choose to abandon the argument you made in paper 2 and/or to write about a different text (although I do not necessarily recommend this approach). If you choose to do this, you must email me by Friday, April 30 with a 1-2 paragraph description of your new paper idea. I also **strongly** recommend you set up a one-on-one meeting with me to discuss your new paper idea (I encourage everyone to meet with me about their final papers, but this is especially true if you decide to change your argument/topic/text).
