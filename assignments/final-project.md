Your final project will be a revision and extension of paper 2. You will add another text to your argument: either a second text from class (that you didn’t write about already in paper 1 or paper 2), OR a text you bring in yourself from outside the class. We will hold in-class workshops on Monday, April 26 and Wednesday, April 28 devoted to developing your ideas for revision and extension of paper 2.

The process of revising and extending paper 2 will necessarily entail some changes to the argument you made in that paper, and some of these changes may be significant. This is expected and even good. However, if you are very unhappy with the argument you made in paper 2, you do have the option to entirely abandon this argument and start over for the final project with a completely different argument and/or text (while this may work for some people, I do not necessarily recommend this approach generally). If you choose to do this, you must email me by Friday, April 30 with a new central question, passage, and a 1-2 paragraph description of your new paper idea (basically a re-do of response paper 4). I also **strongly** recommend you set up a one-on-one meeting with me to discuss your new paper idea (I encourage everyone to meet with me about their final papers, but this is especially true if you decide to completely change your argument).
