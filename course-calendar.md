# Course Calendar
Readings are due – meaning they should be completed – on the dates indicated. Readings marked with “(GD)” are available in our class Google drive folder. All other readings are either linked to here or they are novels/TV episodes/films (see “Required Course Materials” on the Course Info & Policies page).

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on our course site. Use the online calendar to check on reading assignments, rather than this print version, since the print version of this syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.

Monday, February 22
* Salon Staff, “Introduction: The Abu Ghraib Files,” *Salon*, March 14, 2006, <https://www.salon.com/2006/03/14/introduction_2/>
    * NOTE: This article is about the torture of prisoners by US Army personnel in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003 and 2004. The article linked above includes 1 image of torture, though it is not graphic in of itself (but it may still be upsetting due to context). If you would prefer to read a version of the article without the image, you can find one included in our course readings on Google drive. The “chapters” the introduction above links to do include images of torture, and they have all been taken down. However, they are available via the WayBack Machine. You are only required to read the above introduction, NOT any of the chapters it links to.
* Susan Sontag, “Regarding the Torture of Others,” *New York Times Magazine*, May 23, 2004 (GD)
    * NOTE: I’ve included a pdf of this article as it originally appeared in the *New York Times Magazine*. It includes images of torture, but the pdf I’ve provided has a very low reproduction quality, so the images are fuzzy, black, and difficult to see. This is by design.
* Judith Butler, “Torture and the ethics of photography,” *Environment and Planning D: Society and Space* vol. 25 (2007): 951-966 (GD)

Wednesday, February 24
* *Homeland* episodes, “Pilot,” Season 1, episode 1 (2011); “Crossfire,” Season 1, episode 9 (2011)
    * Available [to rent on Amazon for $2.99 an episode](https://www.amazon.com/Homeland-Season-1/dp/B008QTV3X0){:target="_blank"}. Also available via a Showtime streaming subscription.
    * If you want to try to connect the dots between these two episodes and get a sense of the plot of season 1 of the show, [you can read this recap of season 1 published in 2012 in *Rolling Stone*.](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/homeland-cheat-sheet-what-you-need-to-know-for-season-two-79120/) Obviously, this contains a lot of spoilers. But it will give you a sense of how people were talking about the show at the height of its popularity. (This reading is recommended, not required)
