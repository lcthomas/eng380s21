## Response Paper 1
* **Due Friday, Feb 12**
* **Turn in to your team's folder in our class Google drive folder -- .docx or Google docs format**

This response paper is all about how to observe a text, specifically Foer's *Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close*. Your task will be twofold:

1. Observe 1 pattern from what we have read so far of the novel. What do I mean by "pattern?" A pattern is a series of repeated textual, visual, and/or structural elements that are related to each other. To discover your pattern, I recommend you focus your attention on one of the following 3 areas:
    1. Language use. Does Foer repeat certain words or phrases or grammatical constructions? Can you discern a pattern in the kinds of words used in a particular chapter or section of the novel? Are certain words seemingly knowingly left out, or glossed over, or left unsaid?
    2. Format. How Foer organizes some pages in this novel is important. Do certain visual or structural elements repeat? What about the images? How do they relate to the text? What about the visual organization of words on particular pages? Do you see anything there?
    3. Structure and organization. How has Foer organized the novel? Do certain chapter titles or other elements repeat? Do some things about the structure or organization of the novel seem out of place or unexpected?
Your pattern should consist of 3-5 separate observations. You should list these observations in your response paper. Your list should include a brief summary of your pattern, each separate observation (quote directly from the novel where appropriate and/or describe each instance), and the page number(s) of each observation. You should be as specific and as precise as possible when reporting your observations. Your pattern should be unique, meaning no one else on your team should write about the same pattern.

2. Write 1-2 paragraphs about what you see as significant about your pattern. What might this pattern mean in the context of the novel as a whole? You should focus your reflections here not on observations about or summaries of the plot or the "lessons" of the novel, but rather on what you see as the import of Foer's aesthetic choices, as they are revealed by the pattern you have observed. How does the pattern you have observed contribute to larger ideas or concepts in the novel? It's ok if you can't come to any definite conclusions, but you should strive to start to unpack the novel's complexity here (i.e., show your readers how complicated the novel actually is, how weird language is, etc), **not** to deliver a pat interpretation we have already discussed in detail in class or derive a moral lesson from the text.

After completing your response paper, you will upload it to your team's folder in our class Google drive folder. In class on Monday, Feb 15, you will spend time with your teammates talking through the patterns you observed. You will use this work as the basis for response paper 2 (see below). I will not leave individual comments on your response paper this time around; I will simply check that you have completed the assignment.
